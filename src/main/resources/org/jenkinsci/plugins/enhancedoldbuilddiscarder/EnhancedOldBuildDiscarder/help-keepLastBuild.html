    When this option is enabled, the last successful and the last stable build will never be removed 
    regardless of the other settings. The last successful and the last stable build might be the same build.
    In this case, this one build will remain. But, in case the last build is unstable and there is another stable build, 
    both builds will remain. 
    <b>NOTE:</b> this is the default behaviour of the inbuilt Log Rotator from Jenkins"
