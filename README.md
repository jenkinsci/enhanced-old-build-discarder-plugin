Enhanced Old Build Discarder plugin
===========================

Enhanced Old Build Discarder is a Jenkins plugin that extends the functionality of the internal build discard plugin
with an option to prevent discard of builds when the job is unstable, in addition to the ability to require both age
and quantity conditions be met prior to build discard.


The plugin is configured as a build rotation strategy labelled *Enhanced Log Rotator* in the internal *Discard old builds* feature. It can additionally be configured as a Pipeline script using a call to properties() such as:

~~~~
properties([[$class: 'BuildDiscarderProperty', strategy: [$class: 'EnhancedOldBuildDiscarder',
 artifactDaysToKeepStr: '', artifactNumToKeepStr: '', daysToKeepStr: '10', numToKeepStr: '10',
 discardOnlyOnSuccess: false, holdMaxBuilds: true, keepLastBuild: true]]]);
 ~~~~
